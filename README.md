## ðŸ§  Artificial Neural Networks â€“ Plan of Attack

To help you overcome the complexities of Neural Networks, SuperDataScience has developed a **seven-stage Plan of Attack** â€” hopefully not a precursor to what our creations do when sentience awakens within them.

## 1. The Neuron

We'll begin with the foundation of the Neural Network â€” **the Neuron**. We'll explore:

- What it is  
- What it does  
- Where it fits in a Neural Network  
- Why it is important  

The neuron forms the basis of all Neural Networks and is an **imitation (_NAKAL_) of what has been observed in the human brain**. We'll also touch on how the human brain works and why we're trying to replicate it.

## 2. The Activation Function

The **Activation Function** is the process applied to data within the neuron. We'll cover:

- Common activation functions  
- When to use each  
- Their role in enabling complex modeling  

---

## 3. Practical Application

Next, weâ€™ll follow a Neural Network in action. No T-800s here â€” instead of slicing open synthetic skin, weâ€™ll see how a Neural Network can **predict housing prices**. Not as dramatic, but potentially just as impactful!

## 4â€“6. How Neural Networks Learn

Hereâ€™s where the magic happens â€” we dive deep into how learning occurs:

- **Gradient Descent**  
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**  
- **Backpropagation**  

These tutorials will explain how your model improves itself through training and optimization.

---

## 7. Summary

Finally, weâ€™ll wrap it all up with a summary section that reviews **Backpropagation** and how to **compile instructions** for your Neural Network.

Happy Learning! ðŸ˜„
